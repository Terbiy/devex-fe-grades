# 🥅 GOAL OF THE GRADE SYSTEM
  ## Increase level of developers in the company by making a transparent grade system that will answer the following questions: "What is my current level? What should I do to grow?"
   
## ✋ THINGS TO AVOID
1. No connection to real projects/problems
2. Metric jerking
3. Easy-cheesy - everybody is a senior
4. Using hard-skills section as a detailed map (it should be treated as a compass)

 ## ❓ FAQ
