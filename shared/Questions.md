## Feel free to use it as the template for each level

## 🦉 1. What are my responsibilities? ‼️
### This is the main question for everyone. The answer to this question mostly determines your grade. Not years of experience or set of knowledge. 
### Example of responsibilies: deliver X type of tasks on the production independently. 

## 📚 2. What should I know?
### Check hard-skills folder for your competency e.g. [Frontend](/hard-skills/frontend)
### Please keep in mind that list of knowledge should be treated as a compass, not as the map. Knowledge without responsibility, results, and proper soft-skills won't be useful for the company ‼️

## 🆙 3. How to upgrade my current level?
### The easiest way to do it - check next level's responsibilities and start doing them.
### Also, you will find hints in the each level's description. Tip of the day - the easiest way to be upgraded is to start trying to take responsibility of the next level. Of course, it shouldn't violate your current day-to-day tasks

## 🎯 4. On what kind of tasks I will be focused?
### E.g. small improvements, feature parts, features, epics, and so on

## 🍦 5. What kind of a soft-skills are crucial for the different levels?
### Each level requires different soft-skill focus. 

## 6. ✋ What kind of behavior I should avoid?
### It's a team game, so check what things could be damaging for your teammates or company

## 7. 🙍 Who approves the upgrade decision?
### Different people for the different levels. See more info in the level description.
