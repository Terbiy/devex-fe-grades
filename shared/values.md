# 💹 What are our values?

## ✔️ 1. Responsibility 
### Be personally responsible for the result of your team
#### 👍How to👍
I am not satisfied with designer's works on the project X. 
Together with the team we discuss my suggestions for improving the visual appearance/UX, and so on.
We are making the project better together.
#### 👎How not to👎
I am not satisfied with designer's works on the project X. 
I change the appearance of the page on my own without consulting my colleagues.
This leads to conflict in the team and delays the project.

## 🧍 2. Self-organization
### Do more than expected
#### 👍How to👍
I want to make the project Y better. 
I can refactor the old code better while working on a new task as long as it doesn't affect the release and other agreements
#### 👎How not to👎
I want to make the project Y better. 
I constantly rewrite the old parts of the application and because of this, I stretch the time to work on new functionality.
The codebase gets better, but due to the failure of deadlines, the client leaves.

## 🏀 3. Team work
### Do not hesitate to talk about problems and ask for help
#### 👍How to👍
There are a lot of bugs in the project Z due to architectural solutions. 
I ask for advice my experienced colleagues from other teams, together we make a plan to improve the situation. 
Implementing changes according to the plan step-by-step we bring the project to a normal state.
#### 👎How not to👎
While starting working on a new task, I immediately ask more experienced teammates a lot of questions.
No efforts to solve it by myself or proposals from my side were done.
This leads to a decrease in velocity of the entire team due to leaders' overload.

## 🗺️ 4. Curiosity
### Try new things
#### 👍How to👍
In the project T, I suggest trying a new library/framework / approach. 
I discuss the potential benefits with the team leader, choose a way to safely test the changes. 
After receiving the results of experiment, I share the information with my colleagues.
#### 👎How not to👎
There are a lot of bugs in Project T. 
Every month I bring new libraries to it and change the approach to development, without finishing what I've started. 
As a result, there are even more problems on the project.

## ⌚ 5. Quality
### Set a high bar
#### 👍How to👍
Project P has strict deadlines. 
I make complex features on time and pass code review/testing the first time so as not to redo them. 
If I need to sacrifice quality for the sake of velocity I discuss it with the project leaders.
#### 👎How not to👎
Project P has strict deadlines. 
I am developing a perfect process / feature that will solve all the problems. 
I spend so much time on this that I don't have time to work on the project.

## 📇 6. Customer care
### Choose technologies based on business needs
#### 👍How to👍
The client wants Project D to use simple market technologies. 
We assess the risks, discuss them with the client, and select the right team. 
We start the project and in during working on it try to sell our usual approach.
#### 👎How not to👎
The client wants to implement the K library in the project. 
I do it without discussing why it is so necessary, without assessing the risks. 
In case of failure, I reduce the level of confidence in the technical expertise of the team.
