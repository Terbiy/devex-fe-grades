# 👨‍💻 ASSESSMENT PROCESS

## 📢 0. Basic principles
### - Show me the money first - prove your skills, then get an upgrade
### - No magic checkbox - set of hard-skills is here to help you grow, not to guarantee your level up. What's the reason in your knowlege if your Team Lead is crying?
### - Different levels requires different balance between skills - the more you grow - the more your soft-skills are prevail on the hard ones
### - No level downgrades

## 👁️ 1. See the checklist [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PKy3hWqiKJ66MxrWhCk9xprJgO_-g2xnjnB0SvUuosY/edit#gid=893283890)
   ### It contains the following lists:
   ### - L1-L8 grades skills - start with your current level and check out the next one to see what's expected
   ### - Summary - here you will find a full picture for each technology/skill in a one glimpse
   ### How to fill the responsibilities column:
   ### - not working on it - if you don't work with that kind of tasks
   ### - XS - you work with that kind of tasks on rare occasions or often fail to deliver them. Keyword - seldom
   ### - S - sometimes you work with it. Keyword - sometimes
   ### - M - you are familiar with this tasks and often work on them. Keyword - constantly
   ### - L - most of your time is spend on these responsibilities or you are able to fullfil them easily if needed. You can teach other people how to implement them. Keyword - most of the times
   ### - XL - you can implement it blindfolded within minimum amount of ti,e. You've created a detailed how to guides for your project. Keyword - every time 
   
## ✅ 2. Check your progress for each column:
   ### - Responsibilities - defines 66% of your grade, this is the main column
   ### - Soft-skills - defines 22% of your grade
   ### - Hard-skills - helps you to progress with responsibilities
   ### - Add-ons - defines 12% 0f your grade - nice to have side activities
## Please start with the list of your current grade and L+1 grade (to see what's needed to reach the next level). It's not prohibited and could be useful to check previous level, however, we suggest not to spend a lot of meeting's time on previous levels

## 💤 3. Set up a meeting date with your team leader
### Your team lead will fulfill the same checklist about you from his point of view until this date

## 📊 4. Compare your results at the meeting
  ### - If (yourCheckMark && TeamLeadCheckMark === 1) - it could be checked by TL to be sure that everyone is on the same page
  ### - If (yourCheckMark !== TeamLeadCheckMark) - you discuss what's missed during the meeting. If you missed something - TL should create an action plan to fullfil the knowledge gap
  ### - If (yourCheckMark === 0 && TeamLeadCheckMark === 0) - you and your teamleader should mark items that could be important for the future development
  
## 🙋5. Define your grade
  ### Possible outcomes:
  ### - level stays the same
  ### - +1 level upgrade
  
## 🤞6. Outcome of the grade meeting
### Personal development plan

## 🌗 7. Who has the last word about the grade
### Final decision is made by a team leader. It is his/her personal choice and responsibility. We know that every system that is based on KPIs and numbers might be hacked, so trying to keep a reasonable balance between objective and subjective things here.
### Anyway, if you are doing a great job and grow, there is no need in keeping you on the same level for a company

## ⚔️ 8. What should I do if I disagree with decision about my grade?
### - Address your concerns on the meeting with Team Leader
### - Understand what is his/her opinion and what should be done to reach the next level
### - If you didn't found a common ground with your Team Leader you have an option to involve the Head of Department to this discussion (please make sure that there are reasons to do it and prepare strong arguments)
